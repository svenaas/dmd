# Drupal Module Development: An Introduction

The Drupal community has provided a rich and diverse assortment of contributed modules for site builders to choose from, but sometimes you need to develop your own module to get the job done. This presentation will provide an overview of the essential parts of a custom Drupal module, describe key Drupal APIs and concepts, suggest tools for debugging your module code, and teach you where to start if you'd like to contribute your module to the Drupal community. Attendees should have experience building sites in Drupal and a working knowledge of basic PHP code.
